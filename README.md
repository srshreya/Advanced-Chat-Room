Step 6: The admin can kick the user(he can re-join), user can be banned where his username is registered in a text file that will be checked when he wants to rejoin again, the program does not allow that User. [/kick username and /ban username /unban username are the commands]

The user named tanjiro was kicked from the server, however he can rejoin again to the chat room

Step 7: Once the user is banned from the server, he cannot rejoin until the admin unbans him.

We can see the username is stored in the bans.txt file for further blocking of the user to enter the chat room
